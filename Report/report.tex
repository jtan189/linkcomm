\section*{Introduction}

This project explores a method for identifying communities in edge-attributed networks. More specifically, it attempts to identify communities according to edge similarities in the network, using both structural similarity and similarity among edge attributes. A new similarity metric is introduced that encompasses both of these types of similarities, and its effectiveness in identifying communities is tested using two toy networks. The results of experimenting on each of these networks suggest that this new approach may be useful for identifying communities of interest, although the program implementation used to carry out this approach will need to be improved, in order to provide more intuitive and consistent results.

\section*{Related Work}

An important task in identifying communities within networks is to explicitly define what constitutes a community. A common approach is to define a community in terms of nodes and their interconnectivity; a community would correspond to a subset of nodes forming a dense subgraph in the original network. Another approach is to focus on the network links, instead of the nodes. Ahn et al. describe a method for extracting communities using this approach, and show how the resulting link communities naturally incorporate both hierarchical organization and overlap in communities \cite{ahn-lehmann-link-communities-nature-2010}. Salem and Ozcaglar also show how dense subgraph mining can be accomplished for coexpression graphs \cite{Salem:2013:MMF:2500863.2500869}. The approach they utilize consists of two steps: in the first, maximal frequent edgesets are mined, and in the second, highly-connected subgraphs are extracted from the resulting edge-induced subgraphs.\\

Other research has been conducted studying the role node attributes play in the formulation of communities. Silva et al. explore this topic, by analyzing the correlation between attributes sets of nodes and the occurrence of dense subgraphs; they present the Structural Correlation Pattern Mining (SCPM) algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on large real attributed graphs \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1201-6568}.

\section*{Algorithms}

This research combines the structural similarity of edges with the similarity of edge attribute sets for determining communities in a network. The structural similarity metric utilized corresponds to the link similarity metric used by Ahn et al. \cite{ahn-lehmann-link-communities-nature-2010}. Let $n_+(i)$ designate the set of node $i$ and its neighbors. We can then express the similarity of two edges $e_{ik}$ and $e_{jk}$ using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  S_{struct}(e_{ik},e_{jk}) = \frac{|n_+(i) \cap n_+(j)|}{|n_+(i) \cup n_+(j)|}
\end{equation}

An additional similarity metric can be used to quantify the similarity of edges, based on their attribute sets. Let $e_i$ be the set of attributes for edge $i$. The similarity of two edges $e_{ik}$ and $e_{jk}$ is then expressed as follow:

\begin{equation}
  S_{attr}(e_{ik},e_{jk}) = \frac{|e_i \cap e_j|}{|e_i \cup e_j|}
\end{equation}

In this equation, it is important to note that edges not sharing a common node are assigned a similarity of 0, regardless of whether they share attributes. We can combine these two metrics to formulate a more comprehensive similarity metric:

\begin{equation}
  S(e_{ik},e_{jk}) = \alpha (S_{struct}(e_{ik},e_{jk})) + (1-\alpha)(S_{attr}(e_{ik},e_{jk}))
\end{equation}

The specific value of $\alpha$ will determine the proportion of the final similarity measure that either component contributes.

\section*{Experimental Results}

Two scripts were developed to conduct experiments using the approach developed in this research. A Python script is used to calculate edge attribute similarities, and an R script combines this measurement with information on structural similarity for edges. The R script also performs the clustering and visualization tasks, using the \texttt{igraph} package\footnote{http://igraph.sourceforge.net/}. Both scripts made heavy use of a set of programs provided by Ahn et al.\footnote{http://barabasilab.neu.edu/projects/linkcommunities/}.\\

Using these scripts, two toy networks are clustered\footnote{Due to memory issues with Python, it was not possible to experiment on the real DBLP dataset. In the future, this could be accomplished by translating the existing Python script to a more efficient C++ script.}. Each toy network was designed to test different network community scenarios.

\subsection*{Network \#1}

Network \#1 was designed to test the case where two dense subgraphs exist in a network, but within those subgraphs, the attributes for the connecting edges are nonhomogeneous. Figure~\ref{fig:net1_orig} shows the graph for this network, before clustering.\\

\begin{figure}[htp!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{toy2/orig.png}
  \caption{Original graph for Network \#1.}
  \label{fig:net1_orig}
\end{figure}

\newpage
The results of clustering Network \#1 are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:net1_comm}, using both types of similarity metrics.\\

    \label{fig:net1_comm_both_10}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Communities extracted from Network \#1.}
  \label{fig:net1_comm}
\end{figure}

From Figure~\ref{fig:net1_comm}, we can see the effectiveness of the combined similarity metric in identifying communities based on edge attributes. Using structural similarity only, \textit{bob} is clustered together with \textit{amy}, \textit{chris}, and \textit{dana}, even though his edges to the other three nodes have distinct attributes from the edges interconnecting these other three nodes. By placing a greater emphasis on edge attributes in determining edge similarity, the combined approach is able to identify this distinction.\\

Using Network \#1, it is also clear the effect that the chosen $\alpha$ value can have on the resulting clustering. By increasing $\alpha$ from 0.1 to 0.25 (corresponding to a similarity measure that is 25\% structural and 75\% attribute-based), a different clustering is produced (Figure~\ref{fig:net1_comm_both_25}).\\

  \caption{Communities extracted Network \#1 using combined metric (25\% structural).}
  \label{fig:net1_comm_both_25}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:net1_dend_10} and \ref{fig:net1_dend_25} elucidate the reason for these differences. Although the community dendograms for both networks contain the same structure, in the combined similarity approach, the partition density is weakened by the merging of \textit{bob} and \textit{earl} into a larger community. This is due to less emphasis being placed on the fact that the edges \textit{bob-earl} and \textit{dana-greg} share attributes with edges in the smaller communites they join. Since the cutoff threshold used to identify significant communities is based on the maximum partition density, the largest community in Figure~\ref{fig:net1_comm_both_10} is divided into two communities in Figure~\ref{fig:net1_comm_both_25}.\\

\subsection*{Network \#2}

Network \#2 presents an example of a graph that can be divided into three distinct groups, based on edge attributes. However, the subgraphs associated with these groups are not dense. Figure~\ref{fig:net2_orig} shows the graph for this network.\\

\begin{figure}[htp!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.42\linewidth]{toy3/orig.png}
  \caption{Original graph for Network \#2.}
  \label{fig:net2_orig}
\end{figure}
\newpage
As before, this network is clustered using the approach where only structural similarities are considered, and the approach where both structural and edge attribute similarity are considered (Figure~\ref{fig:net2_comm}).\\

\begin{figure}[htp!]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{toy3/no_ea/edge_comm.png}
    \caption{Using structural similarity only.}
    \label{fig:net2_comm_struct}
  \end{subfigure}%

    \label{fig:net2_comm_both}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Communities extracted from Network \#2.}
  \label{fig:net2_comm}
\end{figure}

\vspace{-.8em}
The results of these clusterings may seem unintuitive. As expected, Figure~\ref{fig:net2_comm_struct} shows clusters that are not homogeneous with respect to attributes. However, the combined similarity approach fails to find any distinct sub-communities within the network. Based on shared edge attributes, we might expect the sets \{\textit{amy}, \textit{bob}, \textit{chris}, \textit{dana}\} and \{\textit{earl}, \textit{fred}, \textit{greg}, \textit{haley}\} to belong to the same community. However, since these two communities are separated by edges that only contain the attribute \textit{E}, the combined similarity algorithm assigns the attribute similarity between edges in these two components to be zero. Only edges that directly share a common node can be assigned a nonzero value for attribute similarity.\\

The community dendogram in Figure~\ref{fig:net2_dend} illustrates how the network partition density decreases as additional partitions (communities) are introduced.

\section*{Conclusions}

Based on experiments with two toy networks, clustering graphs using both structural and edge attribute similarities can, in some cases, produce communities that reflect our intuition. For Network \#1, the combined similarity approach was able to produce communities that improve upon those produced by solely measuring structural similarity, if edge attributes are of interest. However, the results of clustering on Network \#2 demonstrate flaws in the algorithm for calculating edge attribute similarity; the clustering results fail to identify any sub-communities in the network, and provide less useful information than that provided by clustering solely on structural similarity. However, it may be possible to address this shortcoming by modifying the algorithm that was used.\\

Another limitation with the approach for combining similarity metrics is the need to specify the value of $\alpha$ to be used. Network \#1 demonstrated how changes to this value can produce very different results. The specific value for $\alpha$ that will result in the most useful identification of communities may depend on the specific network being analyzed.
